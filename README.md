### Introduction to C++

**C++** is a programming language created by __Bjarne Stroustrup__ and his team at Bell Laboratories in 1979.

As the name implies, C++ was derived from the C language. __Bjarne 's__ goal was to add object-oriented programming into C.
	
 	- Why Use C++ :
		- Is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
		- Is an object-oriented programming languge which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
		- Is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be multiple platforms.
	
	- Difference between C and C++ :
		- C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.
		- The main Difference between C and C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.

### HELLO WORLD !

	- C++, like most programming languge, runs line by line, from top to bottom.
	- Here is the structure of a C++ program:
	```
		#include <iostream>
					// ^---> Include libraries
	
		int		main()
		{		//^---> The main function
	   //^---> The beginning of function
			
			// What the program does

		}
	  //^---> End of function
	```
